# GTR2_Steam_Fix
Simple fix for the overlay on the Steam version of GTR 2

Build on VS (or get the release) and replace sudo.exe inside the GTR 2 folder by the new one. Administrator rights are not required to run GTR 2 so you can safely disable it on sudo.exe.

Enjoy time tracking and screenshots!
